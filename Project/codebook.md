* Published on **13 August 2020**
* Based on UCI **Machine Learning Repository** **<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" target="_blank">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (HRA)</a>**

## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset description
The UCI HAR dataset can be found in [Data/UCI HAR Dataset](Data/UCI HAR Dataset). 
See **[UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt)** for a description of the UCI HAR dataset.

## Data files used
The following UCI HAR data files were used in fulfilling the requirements of the course project:

* **[activity_labels.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt)** - Which links the class labels with their activity name.
* **[features.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt)** - Which lists all features, and is used to identify the dataset data columns.
* **[test/subject_test.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt)** - Which identifies the subject that performed the test activity for each window sample.
* **[test/X_test.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt)** - Which contains the test dataset.
* **[test/y_test.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt)** - Which contains the test dataset labels, used to identify the activity performed for each window sample. Labels are linked to data in activity_labels.txt.
* **[train/subject_train.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt)** - Which identifies the subject that performed the training activity for each window sample.
* **[train/X_train.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt)** - Which contains the training dataset.
* **[train/y_train.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt)** - Which contains the training dataset labels, used to identify the activity performed for each window sample. Labels are linked to data in [activity_labels.txt](Data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt).

## Data processing, tidying, and summarizing
The [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script downloads the HAR dataset, tidies it, performs various required data manipulations, and summaries it.

The script flow is as follows:

1. Load required libraries (i.e. dplyr)
2. Create the project data directory
3. Download the HAR dataset to the project data directory
4. Extract Human Activity Recognition dataset in the project data directory
5. Load the features from the HAR dataset
    1. Identify the mean() and std() features
    2. Create syntactically valid variable names from the feature names. These are used as column names for the training and test datasets.
6. Load the activities from the HAR dataset
7. Load the HAR training dataset
    1. Add the training data column names from the syntactically valid feature names created in step 5.2
    2. Add the subject identifiers, and activity identifiers to the training dataset
8. Load the HAR test dataset
    1. Add the test data column names from the syntactically valid feature names created in step 5.2
    2. Add the subject identifiers, and activity identifiers to the test dataset
9. Merge the training and test datasets
    1. Add descriptive activity names from the activities loaded in step 6
    2. Select the mean and std deviation features from the mean and std features identified in step 5.1
    3. Group the merged data by subject and activity
10. Create a tidy summary of feature means grouped by subject and activity
11. Write the tidy summary to file

## Tidy Summary File
The tidy file output at the end of the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script can be found here [tidy_summary.txt](tidy_summary.txt).
The file comprises 68 variables with 180 rows, and there are no missing data.
NOTE: The variable data other than the identifiers are all the mean of the original data.
